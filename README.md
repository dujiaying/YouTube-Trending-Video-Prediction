# Analysis and Prediction of YouTube Trending Videos

YouTube is the world’s most popular video-sharing platform. Its popularity has prompted companies to put their ads on the website. Since the views accurately reflect the scope of audience an ad can reach, it is in the marketing companies’ interest to find out whether a video will go viral to decide where to cast their campaigns on this video.

To achieve this goal, we analyzed the YouTube trending videos in 3 English-speaking countries, Canada, the UK and the US, conducted feature engineering and built a classification model to predict if a video will go viral.
